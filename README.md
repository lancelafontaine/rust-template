# Rust Github Template

A template for [cargo generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) that is the starting point for all of [@lancelafontaine](https://github.com/lancelafontaine)'s Rust projects on GitHub.

This template was originally forked from [`rust-github`'s template](https://github.com/rust-github/template) and customized for my projects.

See the [`rust-github`'s website](https://rust-github.github.io) for details on setting up a new project.
